During the eighth week of our project, we found ourselves nearing the end of our intensive research and development journey. Our focus this week was on refining and simplifying the solid structures within our models. This was a crucial step in ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of our simulations.

On the first day of the week, we undertook an ambitious task: running 174 simulations using SOLIDWORKS software. This was a monumental effort and represented a significant milestone for our project. Each simulation provided valuable data and insights, contributing to the robustness of our models. The sheer volume of simulations conducted was a testament to our team's dedication and the complexity of our project.

Throughout the week, we continued to work diligently on these models. Each day was filled with running additional simulations, analyzing the results, and making necessary adjustments to improve the accuracy and reliability of our models. This iterative process, although time-consuming and sometimes challenging, was essential for refining our project and ensuring we met our research objectives.In addition to our work on the models, we also focused on creating a project pitch video. This video was an important deliverable, due by Friday, and required careful planning and execution. We brainstormed ideas, scripted our narrative, and recorded various segments to highlight the key aspects and achievements of our project. The video needed to be engaging and informative, effectively conveying the significance and potential impact of our research.Simultaneously, we were also working on our research paper. This paper was another critical component of our project, requiring thorough documentation of our methodologies, findings, and conclusions. Writing the research paper was a meticulous process, involving detailed descriptions of our experiments, data analysis, and interpretations. It was important to present our work clearly and concisely, ensuring that our research could be understood and appreciated by others in the field.

As we approached the end of the week, our efforts culminated in the completion of both the project pitch video and the ongoing work on our research paper. The completion of the pitch video by the Friday deadline was a significant achievement, showcasing our project's progress and the team's hard work.
At the end of this project, we were required to submit our group research project. This final submission was the culmination of all our efforts over the past weeks. It included our refined models, simulation results, project pitch video, and comprehensive research paper. The submission marked the conclusion of our intensive research period and the beginning of the next phase, where our work would be reviewed and evaluated.

In summary, the eighth week of our project was a period of intense activity and significant progress. Running a large number of simulations, creating the project pitch video, and working on our research paper were all critical tasks that required dedication and collaboration. As we reached the end of our project, we felt a sense of accomplishment and pride in what we had achieved, ready to present our findings and contributions to the broader scientific community.
