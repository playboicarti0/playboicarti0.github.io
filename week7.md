This week, we jumped straight into the work left over from the previous week, determined to make significant progress. We continued to work diligently on the simplified model, and our efforts began to pay off as our project's progress moved smoothly. Our focus was on changing various parameters within the model and meticulously reviewing the results to understand the differences in each version. This process was essential for refining our model and ensuring its accuracy.

One of the major events this week was our Mid-Summer presentation, which had been postponed from the previous week due to technical difficulties. On Wednesday, we finally had our presentation. The day was significant, and we had a dress code to follow business attire. This added a sense of formality and importance to the occasion. The presentation began at 9 am, and our team was scheduled to present fourth. As the previous teams presented, we prepared and waited for our turn.
When it was finally our time to present, I felt a bit nervous, but I managed to stay focused and deliver our presentation effectively. The preparation and practice paid off, and the presentation went well. This was a crucial moment for us, as it allowed us to showcase our progress and receive feedback that would be valuable for the future steps of our project.

After the presentation day, we returned to the lab the next day to continue working on the remaining tasks. Our lab work was intensive, but the momentum from the successful presentation carried us forward. We were focused on addressing any remaining issues and further refining our model based on the feedback and insights we gained.
Additionally, this week we had another important task: creating a weekly video update on the progress of our project. This video was due on Friday, so we allocated time to plan, record, and edit the video, ensuring it accurately represented our work and achievements. Completing the video was a collaborative effort, and we worked together to make sure it was informative and engaging.

By the end of the week, after submitting the video update, we were able to wrap up our tasks and enjoy some well-deserved free time after 5 pm on Friday. This week was a blend of intense work, significant milestones, and collaborative efforts. The successful presentation and the completion of the video update marked important progress in our project, and we felt a sense of accomplishment as we moved forward.
