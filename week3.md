In the week 3, we started our day going to Business Business Center building auditorium where we work on our project website session which as held by rising Senior Michael Adeleke. He help us to update our project website. On that session, we also learn new thing which was Research paper writing website where we can make our researcher easily. It was quite fun. On that website we uploaded our github work and it help us to make as research paper sample model. We worj on that website until our session end. After that, our next session start  which was about the writing session. The writing session was run by Dr. Anita Pandey. She explain more about the importance of writing while making research paper. Our writing session end at 12:30pm and we had our launch break which was till 1:30pm. After the launch we headed toward our lab and in the lab we started our project in the COMSOL software using different parameter and different data to check the shape of the air flow through different object. Our main goal was to see how the particle changes it direction by changing different dataset. As we continue work on the same for 2-3 days, then we learn about the change in angle of the particle through parameter. At the last day of the week which was Friday where we make our group video for the canvas assignment where we described our goal for the week, each project member accomplishments and challenges during that project. Also at that day we also need to uplaod our weekly basis journal entry. After doing all the work in the lab finally we leave the lab at 5:00pm.
