In Week 3, we kicked off our activities by heading to the Business Center building auditorium, where we had a session dedicated to our project website. This session was led by Michael Adeleke, a rising senior who had extensive experience with website development and project management. Michael guided us through the process of updating our project website, ensuring that it accurately reflected the progress we had made so far. He shared valuable insights on how to organize our content, highlight key milestones, and make the website user-friendly for anyone who might want to follow our research journey.

During this session, we were also introduced to a new and exciting tool: a research paper writing website. This platform was designed to streamline the process of drafting and organizing research papers, making it easier for us to manage our work as we moved forward with our project. The website featured templates and guidelines that helped us structure our paper, from the abstract and introduction to the methodology and results sections. It was quite a fun and engaging experience as we explored the different functionalities of the site. One particularly useful feature was the ability to upload our GitHub work directly into the platform. This integration allowed us to seamlessly incorporate our code, data, and other resources into the research paper, providing a comprehensive and well-organized sample model that we could build upon as our project progressed.

We spent a good portion of the session working on this website, uploading our work, and experimenting with different formats and layouts. The session was both productive and educational, giving us new tools to enhance the quality and efficiency of our research paper writing. By the time the session ended, we had made significant progress in organizing our work and were well-prepared to continue developing our research paper as the project evolved.

After the website session, we transitioned into our next session, which was focused on writingâ€”a critical skill in any research endeavor. This writing session was conducted by Dr. Anita Pandey, who had already established herself as a knowledgeable and inspiring mentor in previous weeks. Dr. Pandey delved deeper into the importance of writing in the context of research. She emphasized that writing is not just a means of documenting findings but is also a powerful tool for communicating complex ideas, arguments, and conclusions to a wider audience. She provided us with tips on how to structure our writing, maintain clarity, and ensure that our arguments were well-supported by evidence. Her insights were invaluable, and the session left us with a stronger understanding of the role that effective writing plays in the success of a research paper.

Our writing session concluded at 12:30 pm, and we took a break for lunch, which lasted until 1:30 pm. This break was a welcome opportunity to relax, refuel, and reflect on the morning's activities before diving back into our project work.

After lunch, we returned to our lab, where we resumed working on our project using the COMSOL software. Our primary focus in the lab was to explore different parameters and data sets to understand how the shape of airflow changes as it moves through various objects. This aspect of the project was critical, as our goal was to model the behavior of particles within the nasal cavity to optimize drug delivery. We experimented with different configurations, adjusting variables to see how they influenced the direction and behavior of the particles. This hands-on work with COMSOL was both challenging and rewarding, as it allowed us to directly apply the theoretical knowledge we had gained to practical simulations.

Over the course of two to three days, we conducted numerous simulations, collecting data on how changes in parameters, such as angle and velocity, affected the airflow and particle movement. We meticulously analyzed this data, learning about the intricate relationships between these variables and how they impacted the overall behavior of the system. This phase of the project was essential for refining our models and improving the accuracy of our simulations.

As the week progressed, our understanding of the project deepened, and we became more proficient with the tools and techniques we were using. By Friday, we were ready to summarize our week's work in a group video, which was part of our Canvas assignment. This video served as a reflective exercise, where we described our goals for the week, the accomplishments of each team member, and the challenges we faced during the project. Creating this video was a collaborative effort, and it allowed us to review our progress, identify areas for improvement, and plan our next steps.

In addition to the video, we were also required to upload our weekly journal entries. These journals provided a detailed account of our individual experiences, insights, and contributions throughout the week. They were an important part of our documentation process, ensuring that we kept a thorough record of our progress and reflections.

By the end of the day, after completing all our tasks in the lab and submitting our assignments, we wrapped up our work and left the lab at 5:00 pm. The week had been intense and filled with learning opportunities, but it was also incredibly fulfilling. We left with a sense of accomplishment, knowing that we were making steady progress toward our research goals and becoming more confident in our abilities to tackle the challenges ahead.
