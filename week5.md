This week, our usual routine took an interesting turn. Instead of heading to the Business Building, we returned to our lab to focus on our project. This shift in environment allowed us to dive deeper into our work, particularly on the samples we received from the University of North Carolina. These samples were real patient samples, adding a significant layer of authenticity and relevance to our project.

We dedicated a substantial amount of time to creating and running various simulations on the nose model. This part of our project is both fascinating and challenging. Each simulation is complex and time-consuming, often taking more than an hour to complete. The process demands precision and patience, as any errors require us to start over, which can be frustrating and labor-intensive.

Despite these challenges, the opportunity to work with real patient samples has been incredibly valuable. It has provided us with a more practical understanding of our project's implications and the potential impact of our research. The simulations, although demanding, are crucial for validating our hypotheses and refining our models.

Throughout the week, we encountered several obstacles, primarily related to the technical aspects of running the simulations. Errors would sometimes halt our progress, necessitating thorough troubleshooting and reruns of the simulations. This iterative process, while tedious, has also been a significant learning experience, teaching us resilience and the importance of meticulous attention to detail.

In summary, this week has been a blend of intense focus, technical challenges, and valuable learning experiences. Working in the lab on real patient samples and running detailed simulations has deepened our understanding of the project and highlighted the real-world applications of our research. The journey is demanding, but the insights gained and the progress made are immensely rewarding.
