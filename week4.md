During this session, we learn about the importance of AI and major impact of the AI like mainly in the educational field. Over the past year the education system have been highy impact due to COVID-19 and later AI took over all over the field but mainly in the educational field. Many AI tool like Chatgpt, Brad, Geimini, etc which are mainly useful for the educational purpose but also have have many downside in educational field too. AI also make students lazy and copying other work. Also, AI have done so much huge impact on the other field. After having that session our next session start which was about the writing. Every Monday we got a look over our writing for our research paper and Dr. Anita Pandey run over the writing process. After having her session we had our 10minute break and after that we meet our high school teacher. My high school teacher name is Daphne Blount. She is a Science teacher. We introduced ourselves to Daphne Blount and she also introduced herself. We talked about our group project to high school teacher and how we have been working on the project. We talked about the goal for our project and what we are going to do later this week. After that we came back to auditorium and Dr. Mack told every group to introduced their high teacher infront of everyone. It was nice session and after that we had our launch break. After our launch break we went to our lab with our high school teacher and show her everthing we have done so far. Next day we work on the data for the nose simulation we we get from our mentor. We had to play with the data for changing different value and look for the outcome and compare different outcome. Our whole day went on that one thing because the simulation take a lot time to run.
