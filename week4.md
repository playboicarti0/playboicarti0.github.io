As we moved into Week 4, our days became increasingly structured and focused, with each session building upon the skills and knowledge we had acquired in previous weeks. We started our day early, arriving at the Business Center building at 9:00 am sharp. Our first session was dedicated to learning and working with LaTeX, a powerful tool for writing research papers. LaTeX is widely used in academia, particularly in fields that require complex formatting, such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering. This session was crucial for us because it provided us with the skills needed to format our research paper professionally, ensuring that our work would meet the high standards expected in scholarly publications.

After spending time familiarizing ourselves with LaTeX, we transitioned into a new session that focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on education. This session was particularly engaging, as it delved into the transformative role that AI has played in recent years, especially in the educational sector. The discussion highlighted how AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Gemini, have become integral to modern education. These tools have revolutionized the way students learn, providing them with immediate access to information, personalized learning experiences, and powerful resources for research and problem-solving.

However, the session also addressed the more controversial aspects of AI in education. While AI has brought about significant advancements, it has also raised concerns about academic integrity and the potential for students to become overly reliant on these tools. The ease with which students can use AI to generate essays, solve problems, or even complete entire assignments has led to worries about reduced critical thinking and the temptation to plagiarize. We discussed the balance that needs to be struck between leveraging AI's benefits and maintaining the integrity of the educational process. The session was eye-opening, prompting us to think critically about how AI is shaping not just education but also society as a whole.

Following the AI session, we continued with our regular Monday routine, which included a writing session led by Dr. Anita Pandey. Dr. Pandey’s sessions had become a staple of our weekly schedule, and they were invaluable for helping us refine our research paper. This week, she focused on the writing process, guiding us through the essential steps of drafting, revising, and editing. Her insights were particularly helpful in teaching us how to structure our arguments, present our findings clearly, and ensure that our writing was both precise and impactful. As always, Dr. Pandey’s session left us better equipped to tackle the challenges of academic writing, reinforcing the importance of clear and effective communication in research.

After Dr. Pandey's session concluded at around midday, we took a brief 10-minute break before moving on to a unique and exciting part of the day—meeting our high school teacher mentor. My high school teacher mentor for this project was Daphne Blount, a dedicated science teacher with a passion for education. Meeting Daphne was a great opportunity to bridge the gap between our current research work and the foundational science education we received in high school. We introduced ourselves to her, sharing our backgrounds, our roles in the project, and our aspirations for the research. In turn, Daphne introduced herself, telling us about her experience in education and her interest in staying connected with cutting-edge research.

We spent time discussing our group project in detail, explaining to Daphne how we were using machine learning to simulate drug delivery within the nasal cavity. We walked her through the goals of our project, the methodologies we were using, and the progress we had made so far. This conversation was not just informative but also collaborative, as Daphne provided valuable feedback and asked insightful questions that helped us think about our project from different perspectives.

After our discussion with Daphne, we returned to the auditorium, where Dr. Mack, one of the program coordinators, asked each group to introduce their high school teacher mentor to the rest of the participants. It was a nice session that allowed us to share our experiences with the broader group and to learn about the diverse backgrounds and expertise of the other high school mentors. This session fostered a sense of community and highlighted the importance of mentorship and collaboration in research.

Following the introductions, we had our lunch break, which gave us some time to relax and recharge before heading back to the lab. After lunch, we took Daphne with us to our lab, where we showed her everything we had been working on so far. We walked her through the simulations we had been running, the data we had collected, and the challenges we had faced. It was a proud moment for us to demonstrate the progress we had made and to explain the complexities of our project in a way that was accessible and engaging.

The next day, we focused intensely on data analysis for the nasal cavity simulations we had been working on. Our mentor provided us with new data sets, and our task was to manipulate these data sets by changing various parameters to observe how they affected the airflow and particle behavior within the nasal cavity. This was a meticulous and time-consuming process, as each simulation required careful setup, execution, and analysis.

We spent the entire day running simulations, tweaking variables, and comparing the outcomes to see how different conditions influenced the results. The goal was to identify patterns and trends that would help us refine our models and improve the accuracy of our simulations. However, the simulations took a significant amount of time to run, sometimes requiring several hours to complete just one iteration. This meant that our work was often a waiting game, with periods of intense activity followed by periods of waiting for the simulations to finish.

Despite the challenges, the day was productive and rewarding. By the end of the day, we had a deeper understanding of the complex interactions within the nasal cavity and had gathered valuable data that would inform the next stages of our research. It was a week of intense focus, learning, and collaboration, culminating in significant progress on our project.

As we wrapped up the week, we reflected on the various sessions and activities we had participated in, from learning new tools like LaTeX to discussing the implications of AI in education, to deepening our research work in the lab. Each experience contributed to our growth as researchers and reinforced the importance of dedication, curiosity, and collaboration in scientific inquiry.
