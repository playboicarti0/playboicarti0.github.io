Starting the week 2, we got a revision session for the website and CITI training. We also got our first group writing session and we learn how the writing is important in research paper. Later that day, we went to our research lab where we again meet our research mentor and have some group chat about the project that we were working on which was about the machine learning to stimulate drug delivery in nasal cavity. That day we learn about the first step for our project which was using COMSOL software. Next day I got new member in our group, his name is Victor. He is our new member in the group. We work on getting hand on the comsol software for the 2D and 3D model and carried out different data workout to see the different outcome on each model. For the following Tuesday and Wednesday we collect the data for 2D and 3D respectively and work on those field. The whole goal plan on working on comsol software was to get more attached to software and get familiar with in for the further use in the research. On the Thursday we work on new software which is called Meshmixer which a software which help to edit and make realistic 3D model. We used this software because our project about nasal cavtiy work easily and smoothly with this software. We used the demo model which are provided inside the software like 3D on rabbit, dog, symbol,etc. On the final day of the week, we got a surprise visit from Dr. Anita Pandey. All the mentor and team member gather and she asked us about the progress in our research and we tell her about project progress. She also talk about the research paper writing. Later that day we make our group video which we need to sumbit it by 5pm which was about the overall progress in our project.
