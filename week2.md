Starting in Week 2, we quickly dove into the practical aspects of our research journey. The week began with a revision session focused on the website and CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) training, both essential components for any research project. The CITI training is particularly important, as it ensures that we understand the ethical considerations and compliance requirements involved in conducting research, particularly when it comes to human subjects and data management.

We also had our first group writing session this week, which was an eye-opening experience. During this session, we learned about the critical role that writing plays in research. It became clear that writing a research paper is not just about documenting findings but also about clearly communicating ideas, methods, and the significance of our work to a broader audience. This session underscored the importance of structure, clarity, and precision in our writing, setting the stage for the work we would eventually compile into our final research paper.

Later that day, we headed to our research lab where we reconnected with our research mentors, Zheng Li and Guiliang Liu, for a group discussion. This meeting was focused on the project we were all excited about: using machine learning to simulate drug delivery in the nasal cavity. During this session, we discussed the project’s objectives, the specific challenges we might face, and how we would begin tackling these challenges. It was during this discussion that we were introduced to COMSOL, a powerful multiphysics simulation software, which would be our primary tool for the initial stages of the project.

The following day brought a new addition to our team—a member named Victor. We welcomed him warmly, and he quickly became an integral part of our group. With Victor on board, we continued our work with COMSOL, focusing on both 2D and 3D modeling. Our goal was to familiarize ourselves with the software, as it would be essential for simulating the complex interactions involved in our project. We spent significant time exploring the software's capabilities, running different simulations, and analyzing the data to understand how various parameters affected the outcomes in both 2D and 3D models. Collecting data on Tuesday and Wednesday for these models was crucial, as it provided us with a deeper understanding of how COMSOL could be used to optimize drug delivery within the nasal cavity.

The entire exercise was designed to help us become proficient with COMSOL, ensuring that we were well-prepared for the more complex simulations that would come later in our research. This hands-on experience was invaluable, as it allowed us to experiment with the software, troubleshoot issues, and learn the intricacies of the modeling process.

On Thursday, we shifted our focus to a new tool: Meshmixer. This software is known for its ability to edit and create realistic 3D models, making it a perfect fit for our project, which involves simulating the nasal cavity—a highly complex and delicate structure. We started by working with demo models available within the software, such as 3D models of a rabbit, dog, and other symbols. These exercises helped us understand how to manipulate and refine 3D models, skills that would be crucial when working on the more detailed and specific models related to our project. Meshmixer's user-friendly interface and powerful editing tools made it easier for us to create realistic models, which would enhance the accuracy of our simulations in COMSOL.

The week culminated in an unexpected but inspiring visit from Dr. Anita Pandey. Her visit was a highlight of the week, as all the mentors and team members gathered to discuss the progress of our research. Dr. Pandey took a keen interest in our work, asking detailed questions about the project's status and our experiences so far. We were excited to share our progress with her, including the challenges we faced and the milestones we had achieved. Her feedback was encouraging, and she also provided valuable insights into the importance of research paper writing, emphasizing the need for clarity, thoroughness, and a strong narrative in our final submission.

Later that day, we shifted gears to work on a group video that summarized our progress. This video was a significant task, as it needed to encapsulate all the work we had done so far and present it in a concise, engaging format. We collaborated closely, deciding what content to include, how to structure the video, and who would present which parts. The video had to be submitted by 5 pm, so we worked efficiently to ensure it was polished and represented our efforts accurately. Completing the video on time was a great way to wrap up the week, and it allowed us to reflect on how much we had accomplished in just a few short days.

In summary, Week 2 was a busy and productive period filled with learning, collaboration, and progress. We deepened our understanding of key tools like COMSOL and Meshmixer, expanded our team with the addition of Victor, and began laying the groundwork for the writing and presentations that would be critical to our project's success. The visit from Dr. Pandey and the creation of our group video provided both motivation and a sense of accomplishment, setting a positive tone for the weeks ahead.
