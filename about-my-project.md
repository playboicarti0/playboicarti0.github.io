## About My Project

Reduced order model development with machine learning to simulate drug delivery in nasal cavity

Problem: 
Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Capture physiological data such as EEG and EMG from the human body.
  - Process raw sensor data and classify events such as gestures (e.g., arm movements) and emotional states (e.g., attention levels)
  - Map output from physiological sensors to a physical robot. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the DREU program. The poster will focus on the system's technical architecture.
