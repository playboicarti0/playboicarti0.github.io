Reduced Order Model Development with Machine Learning to Simulate Drug Delivery in the Nasal Cavity

Problem: The process of drug delivery within the nasal cavity is complex, involving various fluid dynamics and anatomical factors. Traditional simulations can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. There is a need for a more efficient approach that can accurately predict drug delivery outcomes with reduced computational costs.

Approach:
During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather relevant datasets related to nasal cavity structures and drug delivery dynamics. Preprocess the data to create suitable inputs for machine learning models.

Model Development: Develop a machine learning-based reduced order model (ROM) that simplifies the full-scale computational simulations. This model will be trained to predict outcomes using a minimal set of features while maintaining accuracy.

Validation and Testing: Validate the ROM by comparing its predictions with results from traditional simulations or experimental data. Refine the model based on performance metrics.

Integration and Optimization: Integrate the ROM into a simulation framework that can be used by researchers or clinicians. Optimize the model for speed and accuracy, ensuring it can be run on standard computational resources.

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a validated reduced order model capable of efficiently simulating drug delivery in the nasal cavity. This model will significantly reduce computational time and resources required for simulations, making it more accessible for research and clinical applications.
