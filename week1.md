During the first week of our research program, we received a warm and enthusiastic welcome from the entire research community. The atmosphere was vibrant and filled with excitement as we were introduced to the various members who would be guiding and supporting us throughout our journey. This initial introduction was not only an opportunity to learn more about the program and its objectives but also a chance to meet the people who would become our colleagues and collaborators over the coming weeks.

The week began with an institute-wide orientation, which was designed to familiarize us with the facilities, resources, and expectations for the program. This orientation was comprehensive, covering everything from administrative details to the broader goals of the research we would be undertaking. It set the tone for the weeks ahead, emphasizing the importance of collaboration, innovation, and dedication.

One of the most memorable parts of this week was meeting my team members for the first time. We gathered together, and it was a great opportunity to start building relationships that would be crucial for our teamwork. I was introduced to my mentor, Zheng Li, and another key team member, Guiliang Liu. They welcomed me warmly and quickly made me feel like an integral part of the team. We discussed our group project, which was centered on using machine learning to simulate drug delivery in the nasal cavity. This project immediately captured my interest, as it combined cutting-edge technology with important medical applications.

After our initial discussions, we had the chance to bond further over lunch. Sharing a meal together was a wonderful way to break the ice and get to know each other on a more personal level. We talked not only about our project but also about our backgrounds, interests, and what had brought us to this research program. The conversation was engaging, and it was clear that everyone was passionate about the work we were about to undertake.

Following lunch, we participated in a team-building game, which was both fun and insightful. This activity was designed to help us develop a sense of camaraderie and trust within the team. It also highlighted the importance of communication and collaboration, which would be vital for the success of our project. The game allowed us to see each other's strengths and how we could complement one another in the research process.

After the lunch break and team-building activity, we returned to the auditorium for a continuation of our orientation sessions, which included detailed discussions about our project. These sessions provided us with a deeper understanding of the scientific and technical challenges we would be tackling. We were briefed on the methodologies we would be using, the goals we were aiming to achieve, and the expectations for our contributions to the project. This was an important moment for setting the groundwork for our research and clarifying our roles and responsibilities within the team.

The first week was a blend of introductions, orientation activities, and initial project discussions, all of which were essential for laying a strong foundation for the work ahead. By the end of the week, I felt well-prepared and excited to dive into the research. The warm welcome, coupled with the detailed briefings and the opportunity to connect with my team, made for a productive and inspiring start to the program. It was clear that we were not just embarking on a research project but also becoming part of a community dedicated to advancing knowledge and making a meaningful impact.
